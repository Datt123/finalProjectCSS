          <p>Apple Inc. had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephen G. Wozniak to build his own computer—a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, which came as a kit and used the recently invented microprocessor chip. Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair, Wozniak quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer.

        <section class="achievements">
          <h2>Our Achievements</h2>
          <p>Apple has shaped the global market with its iconic products, including the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. Presently, Apple holds the top position among technology firms in terms of revenue, reporting a staggering $394.3 billion in 2022. Moreover, it holds the distinction of being the world’s largest company by market capitalization, with a reported $2.54 trillion in market cap in 2023. Notably, Apple has achieved a remarkable feat by surpassing a $3 trillion market cap, making it the sole company in recorded history to reach this milestone.</p>
          <p>Established in 1976 under the name “Apple Computer Company” by visionaries Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Ronald Wayne, and Mike Markkula, the company has undergone transformative growth. Tim Cook has been at the helm as Chief Executive Officer since 2011, steering Apple through an era of immense success. However, Apple faced numerous challenges in its early years, struggling to gain market share, drive sales, and execute effective advertising campaigns. </p>
          <p>A prominent obstacle was the presence of a formidable competitor: IBM. As an established and trusted electronics company catering to consumers, IBM proved to be a formidable force that hindered Apple’s market penetration and ability to foster customer and brand loyalty.</p>
          <p>Amidst these trials, Apple experienced a series of transformative events, including the departure and subsequent return of founder Steve Jobs. These turning points played a pivotal role in Apple’s journey toward improved success. Today, we delve into the primary factors behind Apple’s tumultuous path to success and examine the key reasons that will continue to fuel its prosperity.</p>
          <p>Apple’s latest annual 10K report reveals staggering financial figures, with a remarkable $394.3 billion in revenue. Delving further into the income statement, the company’s gross profit stands at an impressive $170.8 billion, while its net income reaches a substantial $99.8 billion. The net income figure represents the capital remaining within the firm after deducting all necessary expenses incurred in the process of selling its products. These expenses encompass various categories, including advertising, cost of goods sold, depreciation, and taxes. Examining Apple’s extraordinary financial performance, we will explore the top three factors that contribute to its exceptional results.</p>

        <section class="team-culture">
          <h2>Our Team and Culture</h2>
          <p>Apple’s organizational culture is a key factor in the continuing success of its business. The consumer electronics company’s organizational or corporate culture establishes and maintains the business philosophy, core values, beliefs, and related behaviors among employees. This business analysis case shows that Apple has a work culture that motivates human resources to support strategic objectives for competitiveness. For example, the company’s cultural traits are aligned with the drive for innovation, which is a major factor that determines business competitiveness in the information technology, online services, and consumer electronics industries. </p>
          <p>With this company culture, business operations facilitate the fulfillment of Apple’s mission statement and vision statement. Through the leadership of Tim Cook, the company continues to enhance its cultural characteristics to maximize human resource support for business relevance in various markets around the world. Apple shapes its business culture and uses it as a tool for strategic management and multinational business success.</p>
          <p>Apple’s company culture strengthens competitive advantages over other firms in various industries. The company’s products compete with the consumer electronics and online services of Google (Alphabet), Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon, and Sony. Also, Apple TV Plus competes with the video streaming services of Disney, Facebook (Meta), and Netflix. These competitors impose a strong external force that influences strategic management among firms in the industry, as illustrated in the Five Forces analysis of Apple Inc. As a result, cultural traits must reinforce the iPhone maker’s business competitive advantages through its workforce. It can be argued that Apple partially achieves this strategic objective through the effects of its organizational culture on workers’ behavior and job performance.</p>
          <p>Apple has an organizational culture for creative innovation. The company’s cultural features focus on maintaining a high level of innovation that involves workers’ creativity and a mindset that challenges conventions and standards, such as in consumer electronics design. The IT business depends on cultural support and coherence, which are determinants of competitiveness and industry leadership, especially in addressing aggressive and rapid technological innovation and product development.</p>
